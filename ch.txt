It was pure fire that Mr. Woo opened his eyes .
It was because of the feeling of a long way.

It's like scratching with a small spoon
It was annoying. Well then
He did not ignore his senses.

Goon Woo took off the silver thread that was squeezing his neck

Goon Woo moved forward with joy .
At that moment, the table was lying on the floor
One dagger was kicked.

The dagger is precisely the hair of the woo-kun
It flew away .

The thing I was most confident about was the sword.

As the length of the sword is different, he spreads the sword ball

He is one of the swordsmen of the Qing Seongpa.

Pyo-wol felt an extreme sense of crisis.
He is the weightlifter in the sword of Woo-kun
It was so great that I couldn't even bear it.

Phi Pip!

In an instant , Pyo Wol was wounded in three places .
I wore it.

Each wound was not light.

Pyo Wol screams and shakes his body

Goon Woo-sang is heading towards such a pyo-wol again.
He blew a kite.

Pyo-wol is a short-lived difference, so all the balls

A cruel debt came to mind in Woo-sang's eyes

He is like, and the sheep have mice.
They put pressure on the table in a playful way. his biggest ball be
On the sword, the whole body of the table is gradually drained of blood.

He taught me the seasons with

It was probably from that time .

It's like learning martial arts anymore
It 's not fun .

Others have to be wrong for more than a year
He learned martial arts in a month . yes
As I learned it easily, I was excited about nothing.
Rather, it fell. yes then then
From then on , I started to be interested in women .
There were many women who admired him .

He, too, was an old-fashioned, high-spirited man.
He doesn't mind the woman who comes to Ki.
It was. If it were just that, it would be so big
It wouldn't have been a problem.

The problem is that he forced a woman
I woke up drunk. At that time, Woo-gun Sang-eun
Drunk and disenchanted
It was Tae.

Then he met a woman, and
In beauty, the friend becomes a beast
She was forced to drink.

"Did that bitch's father sent you?"
A woman who raped Pyo Wol by herself
I misunderstood that it was sent by my father .
A woman 's father is known from afar
It was Kwon Se-ga . A few assassins are enough
I had the property to hire.

Pyo-wol did not answer.

His demeanor is such an upset
It made it even more explosive.

Goon Woo-sang seems to be arguing with Pyo-wol

Angry to the end
I changed the ball .

Instead of the blue cloud, the sword was fluttered in the blue sky.
Seventy-two wave sword, one of the secret swords of the
It was ( „Ö† +- tt huh ) .

It's like the waves are hitting me seventy-two times
Han Yeon-hwan's swordsmanship is a certain expert of Kang-ho
It's too hard to take it easily
I had power .

The Seventy-Twelve Black Blue Seongpa's Best Sword Gong
It was not . stronger than that
Even if I have a few more sword balls
It is the most familiar to open the deep sword.
It was because of this .

From a young age, he was immersed in a sword of seventy-two.
I was drunk. He is so perfect even with his eyes closed
Have you reached a point where you can spread out?
It has been a long time .

See Sit!

A sharp sword strikes like waves one after another
came to me .

Even if it's just a minute
It looked like it was going to be in danger .

Pyo Wol was beaten down by himself
I fled behind the woman .

" Move "

Goon Woo-sang made love a while ago
He kicked the woman 's body . to him
The woman who got beaten bounced off the wall
stuck .

Because of that, Woo‚Äôs nerves for a moment
Distributed.

It was then .

The thing with a little red light in the eyes of the moon .
He's like someone who gave up on everything
like to swing a sword in the wrong direction
said Ôºé

There was a small smile on the corner of Woo-kun-sang's mouth.
"Young Traces ".09Ôºé"

Cah !

Then the unbelievable thing happened.
Woo-gun, who was raging wildly like a wave
's sword was blocked by Pyo-wol 's sword .
what

Kun-sang Woo said it was a coincidence and said Chuckoo.
Seventy and seventy-two swords were spread out.

Kang!

But again , his black mark
I was blocked by the sword .

Knowing in advance the sword of Chiu-kun
Presumably , Pyo Wol cut his pulse .
hung up .

In fact .

The seventy-two black votes spread by the allies
It was the martial arts that Wol knew.

The unknown sword ball that I learned in the underground cavity
This was the seventy-two sword.
All three children wield seventy-two swords.
I got used to it. two of them are children
died in the attack of the , only Pyo Wol
He survived.

Pyo Wol used a sword of seventy-two to die for.
I got used to it. That's why he's more than seventy-two
He was well aware of the futility of the sword.
Although achievement lags behind
It may be lost , but as much as destroying it
surpassed .

The seventy-twelf black is simply
It was nothing more than a sword that was ripe in the hand , but it was
To the seventy-two black men or men
There was only one hope that could be expected
all .

wash !
Pyo Wol stabbed his sword .

It was an ordinary stab that relied on the senses.
However, its speed and direction are
Exceeded expectations.

Heart rate (4>18).

The speed of the mind moved the body.
It was a blow that staked everything in the table.
In this one chance, Pyo-wol is his
I decided to drive .

Whoops!

The sword pierced my chest .

Pyo Wol 's sword pierces through Lee Woo - sang 's chest
I lost this

+ lol
Mr. Woo vomited blood.

The blood he shed is full of blood
Wet your face .

"Yeah, how do you get a seventy-two sword?"
I did not know Pyo Wol , but he was meaningless
The swords spread out during the ceremony were of the seventy-two swords.
It was a vegetarian meal .

He spread the sword of the seventy-two
This is what destroyed this wave sword .

No one else knows, but Woo-kun is that
I know the thread .

Pyo-wol did not answer.

He couldn't.

If you open your mouth, your energy will scatter and you will fall
Because it seemed to be the door .

In this short moment of confrontation, Pyo Wol-eun
I poured out all of God .

The key is to give Woo-kun a seventy-two sword
It was to spread out . Im Sa-yeol is nothing
The swordsman of the people, that is, the seventy-two swords is the target.
I used to say that it was a woman 's name .
I only have to spread the seventy-two swords to my friend.
I thought that there is a chance of winning if you do. that
So desperately taking time, seventeen
This is what made this wave sword unfold .
It is also this time that the heart was used in practice.
This was the first time.

It was a gamble to risk my life .
His gamble was successful , but at the cost of
I was seriously injured . One time even suck
Li had to get out of this place.

Pyo-wol looked at the woman for a moment.
Eun-Sin, a woman who was beaten by Mr. Woo
She was losing.

The table wall is left as it is, through the ventilation
He came out of the smoke field.

From now on , it was a battle against time .
Before they noticed
I had to go as far away as possible.
Cheongil-eun was one of the great disciples of the Cheongseong faction
He was the head of the drug seon party by name.

Although the ambassador, Cheong-yeop, or Lee, the death penalty
Myeong and Hook are as strong as Woo-kun Sang
However , he has a deep knowledge of alcohol , and many
He was respected by his disciples.

Cheong Il-eun with a frown on the forehead
He looked at Jain Jingwang.

" What do you mean by that ? Do Jin Yi Kyung
Are you there? Do Jin-eun walks around the Dokwan
Weren't you collecting herbs?"
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I know it‚Ä¶‚Äù
Jin Kwang made a confused expression on his face.
Gather the herbs from each conduit to Dojin.
He was the one who told me to come .
He heard a mournful noise that day.
Before long, he took his orders and went out.
For what reason is Dun Do-Jin, that Cheong Seongpa
That 's all I heard .

Proof of the disciples that they actually saw Jin
There was also .

Jin Kwang-eun searched for Do-jin and searched the Cheongseong faction.

Could not find .

" That 's very strange . Do Jin dares my
Don't even disobey orders.
Are you running around as you please?‚Äù
" I've been looking for that too , but uh
I can't even see it."

‚ÄúIs there something the other disciples did not see well?
No more?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeveral people said they saw it.‚Äù
"Where was the last time you saw Dojin?
More?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs near Myungwoljeon.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go see it.‚Äù

" Yes "

The two of them left the temple about Myungwol
I went nearby.

The Qing and the Japanese attached the Mujin to protect the Myungwoljeon.
I grabbed it and asked .
"Have you ever seen Jin?"

‚ÄúDid you see them roaming nearby?
scoop

080 pack

" Yes ! How are you?‚Äù

Cheongil frowned instead of answering.
I didn't have a good feeling for something.

You have to go through the conduit and collect the herbs.
The fact that Do Jin returned without a word
It's strange, but if this is the case, around Myeong-wol
You are standing still. something unknown
This was happening.

Suddenly, Cheongil's gaze turned to Myungwoljeon.
all .
"Is the mycosis mycosis inside?"

" Yes ! I am doing lung duct exercises.‚Äù

"I'm going to tell him I'm going to sleep.
I'll give it to you."

Sun gong air air go

The face of this great disciple hesitates
It broke with this .

‚ÄúDid you ever bring in a hot woman?‚Äù
" sorry ."

This great disciple hastily bowed his head .
In a job that no one else asks for a disciple
I couldn't dare to tell a lie.
" I will go into Han . "

Cheongil shoved Lee the great disciple and Myeongwol
I went inside . This great disciple dares
I couldn't dare to stop him.

‚ÄúUgh! What do we do ?"

He predicts that the lightning will fall soon .
Disgusted and hastily followed Cheongil's footsteps.
Chung Il-eun, who looked around Myeong-wol Jeon for a while
The mouth that enters my underground smoke room
He found the sphere.

One of the main barriers to operating an institution
It opened with a sound.

Chong Il , Jin Kwang , and Lee the great disciple opened the entrance .
It went down to the underground smoke field. that
What greeted them was a poem by Woo-gun
It was God .

‚ÄúWhat? Homemade!‚Äù

Cheong-il is surprised and runs to Sang-woo
I opened it. But Woo-sang is already out of breath
It was disconnected.

‚ÄúWho dares to buy a priest!‚Äù

Sino-Japanese roar resounds in the underground smokehouse
spread .

Jin Kwang, who grasped the situation, with an auditory sense
I ran and shouted.

" It 's an assassin . Assassin kills military sergeant
